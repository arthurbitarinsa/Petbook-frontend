PETBOOK PROJECT

This Petbook project draws its idea from Facebook, it is an app/site where you post and talk about your Pet, 
The Frontend was done by React JS while the backend was done by Djanjo (Python), the Project is fully reactive and functional with an established connection between the frontend and the backend, However, the feedback from the Coach leaves a ot of work left for the frontend as the designs are not well completed regardless of the fact that there is a lot of functionalitits in the website, in addition, we agreed to continue working on this project so that we establish a complete simulation of the Facebook but this toime having pets instead of people,  

The deployment on Netflify had some internal errors and now i am gonna deploy on Heroku and Github, however, all the branches on Github were merged and the repository is fully functional.
 Still alot of work is left to do
